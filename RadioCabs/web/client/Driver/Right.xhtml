                <p style="text-align: justify">During the spring and summer of 1946 two groups of WWII Veterans held meetings to discuss creating new taxi companies. One group called themselves Tuxedo Cab, the other — Radio Cab. Each group appeared before the Portland City Council to request taxi company operating permits. City Council told them to leave, join forces and come back as one company. They got together, appeared before Council as Radio Tuxedo Cab Company, and were granted 35 taxi permits to operate in the City of Portland, Oregon.</p>
